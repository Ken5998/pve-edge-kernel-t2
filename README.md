# Proxmox Edge kernels

Custom Linux kernels for Proxmox VE 9 - Fork to add support for T2 Macs.

The fork simply contains the CI setup to compile kernels using the scripts and documentation from [fabianishere/pve-edge-kernel](https://github.com/fabianishere/pve-edge-kernel), [proxmox/pve-kernel](https://github.com/proxmox/pve-kernel) and [additional patches](https://github.com/t2linux/linux-t2-patches) to support T2 Macs.

You should also refer to the [t2linux wiki](https://wiki.t2linux.org/) for help regarding miscellaneous topics related to T2 Macs.

Many people need control of fans for Proxmox, so I am linking the fan guide [here](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/fan/).

## Installation
Select the kernel required from the [Releases](https://github.com/Ken5998/pve-edge-kernel-t2/releases)
page you want to install and download the appropriate Debian packages.
Then, you can install the packages as follows:

```sh
apt install ./pve-kernel-VERSION_amd64.deb
```

## Building manually
You may also choose to manually build one of these kernels yourself. Refer to the [CI](https://github.com/Ken5998/pve-edge-kernel-t2/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) for help.

#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have at least 10 GB of free space available and have the following
packages installed:

```bash
apt install devscripts debhelper equivs git
```

## Removal
Use `apt` to remove individual kernel packages from your system. If you want
to remove all packages from a particular kernel release, use the following
command:

```bash
apt remove pve-kernel-6.5*t2 pve-headers-6.5*t2
```
